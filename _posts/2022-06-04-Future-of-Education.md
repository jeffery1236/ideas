Recently, I came across a book called *Imaginable* by Jane McGonigal. I realised I spend almost all of my conscious hours on just endless tasks. Even my 'breaks' involve some activity and there is no time for my mind to just run wild and imagine like we all did back when we were kids.

I am starting a new project where I will imagine the future in a specific area or a specific future scenario. It may not be the most likely future but hopefully I will come with some interesting ideas.

So what will the future of higher education be like? From my perspective, the goal of higher education has shifted from teaching critical thinking skills to just preparing you for a job. Ask a random Singaporean teen, "why should you go to university?". The answer you get will probably be around the lines of "to get a good paying job".

With this in mind, I foresee that ranking systems such as Times Higher Education University Rankings will start prioritizing industry outcomes more. As the same time, university coursework will become more and more intertwined with companies in a bid to make their curriculum more industry-relevant/practical. Imagine being a college student and every course you take will include guest lectures from industry leaders and final projects partnering with companies. For example, a course on computer vision might partner with a robotics startup to develop a object detection module. A course on developmental psychology might partner with a child tuition center to improve their teaching curriculum.

As this progresses, we might start see-ing well-renowned companies start their own school related to the field they are in. I would not be surprised if Google created a school that only teaches computer science. They have the expertise and the brand to provide the accreditation. The only challenge for them is to reproduce the college social experience which wouldn't be impossible given their fancy slides and amazing food.

Other interesting ideas I got were:
1. [Learn from everywhere](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/four-trends-that-will-shape-the-future-of-higher-education/): Remote learning will enable schools to design programs across locations. Imagine a university program where you take on-campus courses then have practical experiences in China while creating your own enterprise (example given in link)
2. < For you to tell me >

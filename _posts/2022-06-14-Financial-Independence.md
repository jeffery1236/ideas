A few weeks back, one of my friend asked me an interesting question, "Jeff, how much do you think you need to retire comfortably?" (You know who you are). I was taken aback, there were too many variables to consider. Coincidentally, I got the COVID-19 virus and spent my relaxing quarantine researching about this problem. It gave me something to plan for, something to look forward to, something to get excited about.

For all you people similar to me, you know how important it is to have something to get excited about. It just gets you through the boring and tough things you have do. So financial independence was that thing for a good few weeks. I looked at the differen subreddits (FatFIRE) and researched into how to caclulate your how much you need (25 * your expected annual expense). I also brainstormed different ideas on how to go about achieving it (real estate investing, stocks, side hustles, etc).

However, one day, a thought came to my mind. I have not even started my career. Yet, I am already looking forward to ending it. Say I achieve FIRE (financial independence retire early) by 40 and gain the freedom to do whatever I enjoy, by then I will already have spent a good bulk of my prime just thinking "I will enjoy my life when this is over". Furthermore, after I achieve FIRE, there are no guarantees that I will know what I truly enjoy doing then and its back to square one.

Of course, the caveat here is I don't severely lack money and am in a position to choose between optimizing for pure monetary gain or other objectives. What is the alternative? Start thinking about jobs that you might enjoy/learn more/< insert whatever objectives you have > right now and try them out in the most minimal way possible.

Have you wondered how humans will be like in a thousand years time? Many science-fiction movies have attempted to envision a version of this. For example in Dune, humans banned the use of A.I. and evolved into a few sub-species such as the Mentats (human calculators) and Bene Gesserit (ability to sense the truth).

With the improvements in healthcare technologies, infant mortality is at a all-time low and evolution may start favour physical health less. I came across a [book](https://solomon.rice.edu/writing/books/) by Evolutionary Biologist Scott Solomon who suggests a few trends that will affect our future as a species.

1. An increasing trend of immigration due to globalization will result in less location-based adaptations. In the past, humans mostly stayed in the same locations. As a result, people in different locations developed different adaptions. For instance, humans living near the equator had darker skin tones as the melatonin acted as a 'natural sunscreen'. With increased global mobility, we would see less of these adaptions.
